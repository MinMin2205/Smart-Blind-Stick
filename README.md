# Smart-Blind-Stick
The project is to design a sound and vibration based alerting system for the blind people with Ultrasonic Sensors. The controlling device of the whole system is microcontroller. It guides the visually impaired person in his navigation independently in an efficient manner ensuring the person’s safety through vibrations and sound.
User’s live location will also be visible to the guardian so that the whereabouts of the user can be known anytime.
The device will continue to scan for obstacles and provide feedback to the user until the user stops or turns off the device.
